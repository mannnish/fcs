### choosing ml model
- Lets understand our requirement, we have two variables as our input that is temperature and year.
- we need to predict the crop production for the next 10 years. 
- so it boils down to a __bi/ multi-variate regression problem__.
- __but!!__
- here one of the input taken as x is nothing but time and hence this becomes a time series problem.
- one of the most commonly used methods for multivariate time series forecasting â€“ __Vector Auto Regression (VAR)__.
